#### Abstract:

- Melanoma, a form of skin cancer, arises due to malignant transformations in cells, leading to uncontrolled proliferation and spreading of abnormal cells.

- The occurrence of melanoma isn't restricted to sun-exposed areas; it can develop on any body part.

- The term "benign" denotes a non-cancerous condition or growth.

- Benign skin lesions, which encompass moles, freckles, and skin tags, are typically harmless and lack substantial health risks.
